PROJECT EDA

For this project I will be exploring the two data sets of biodiversity in national parks.

The aims of this project will be:

- to explore the data and values inside the dataset
- to understand the shape of the data and what kind of narratives can be extracted from it later on
- understand the type of cleaning needed to begin analysis
- begin analysing and drawing conclusions and possible correlations within the data
- extract an analysis of the data with key findings.
